# Smartbox Technical Test

## What is this?
This is my piece of code for Smartbox Technical Test.

## How to run?
```
npm install && gulp serve
```

## But it is not completed, what happended?
Well, in the moment I received the test I could TOTALLY visualisate (in angular) a list of Beatles' albums and info, with a list of the album covers (you may see in the assets folders a placeholder cover and some css that I intended to use) and that's when my problems started, after fourty minutes I realised that the covers' image endpoint is only accessible through authentication, so I have to change all my plans.

Then I thought, humm... I think I could show a list of the last five albums with a show more button, but my quite basic knowledge of Knockout JS made it impossible to me, as it happened in the detail page but what could I have done? The time has already gone.

## What did I learned?
First of all, I would like to say that I don't regret of using a framework I didn't know for such an important test. 
I wouldn't do it in angular just to show that I am good at something and don't learn anything with it. 
I really apreciated the challenge, even taking into account all the frustration I have with the framework.

So I learned to start from the basic, next time I should first make sure I am delivering all the required points before trying to something different. Actually, I should just have followed what my Facebook cover says "First, do it. Then, do it right. Then, do it better.".

To end up, I am glad to have had the oportunity to do it :)
